# Image Recognizer for iOS

Hello GitHub ðŸ™‚<br/>
This is my machine learning application which uses MobileNetV2 under the CoreMl library. <br/>

In this application users can upload a picture in their gallery and my software recognize that picture.<br/>
After that application tag this picture with accuracy rate which's like __"%25 it's plane"
